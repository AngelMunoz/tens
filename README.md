# Tens in Elmish
I  recorded 2 hours of me developing a simple game in Fable Elmish from start to finish. Here is the link to the video: https://youtu.be/jeYlmH2NlTw

Motivation for this video came from this tweet by Ryan Florence: https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1219351388775256064
I wanted to try out how this could be build with the help of the Elm Architecture.

## Building and running the app

First of all, start with installing the project's npm dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
Once this is finished, you can then build and compile the project:
```
npm run build
```
You can start developing the application in watch mode using the webpack development server:
```
npm start
```
After the first compilation is finished, navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the application.

### VS Code

If you happen to use Visual Studio Code, simply hitting F5 will start the development watch mode for you and opens your default browser navigating to http://localhost:8080.
